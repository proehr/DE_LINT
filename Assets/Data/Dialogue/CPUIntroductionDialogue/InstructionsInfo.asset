  message: 'For the purpose of this game, instructions are made up of three parts:
    The instruction type (ADD, MOVE) and two parameters. The parameters can either
    be memory addresses, register addresses or constant values. The first parameter
    indicates, where the result of the instruction is supposed to be saved. For example,
    "ADD Register 1 Register 2"  would be executed, by summing the values in Register
    1 and Register 2 and writing the result into Register 1.'
