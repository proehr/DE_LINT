  message: Registers are small storage units. Since they are placed inside the CPU,
    read and write operations on registers are very fast. The most important registers
    are the Program Counter and the Instruction Register. The Program Counter holds
    the memory address of the next instruction that is supposed to be executed. When
    the CPU fetches this instruction it is saved into the Instruction Register.
