  message: 'Secondary storage can not be accessed directly by the CPU, but unlike
    the primary storage, it is non-volatile. This means, the stored data is retained
    even when the power is shut off. The PC you have here contains two types of secondary
    storage: A hard disk drive (HDD) and a solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs make use
    of a more modern approach to storage, which allows faster data access, but also
    makes SSDs more expensive.'
